Home Repo-
Replica of the Home Depot website using service-oriented architecture.

• Built an image carousel that rendered 6 items with price using React and rendered items from a MYSQL database using an axios call.

• Created a server using Express.js with the ability to complete GET requests to the database.

• Created a MYSQL schema with 15+ items with unique IDs for easier GET requests.


Implemented:

As a user, I should be able to add items from the image carousel to my shopping cart.


As a user, I should be able to select any item and preview that item get a description as well as different angles of it.
